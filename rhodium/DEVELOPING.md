# Developing Rhodium

Read the package [`README.md`](README.md) first for its public profiles,
interfaces, and consumer-facing package map. This guide owns Rhodium's
implementation boundaries and direct-dependency contract. For repository-wide
development setup and workflow, see the project [`DEVELOPING.md`](../DEVELOPING.md).

Rhodium has one backend-independent hardware model and several authoring
profiles. Existing frontend paths elaborate into public core module IR. Core
also owns a retained composition level for selective implementation lowering;
frontend syntax is not a second IR. Its staged integration is tracked in the
[selective lowering plan](core/SELECTIVE_LOWERING_PLAN.md).

## Implementation architecture

Arrows mean "may depend directly on." They point inward toward the public IR;
no reverse dependency is allowed.

`#lang rhodium` is the curated language. `#lang rhodium/base` is the composition
profile: it exposes the foundation and allows a program to import only the
language layers it wants. The word *base* names the public profile; the
internal module implementing its shared frontend forms is called the
*foundation*. The frontend guide explains
[profile selection and elaboration](frontend/README.md).

The frontend kernel's optional semantic expansion hooks depend only on core
`SemanticNode` records. The interface layer exports transform descriptions
through those hooks; no simulator or backend dependency is introduced. See the
[retention implementation guide](frontend/DEVELOPING.md#layered-semantic-retention).

The frontend kernel also imports the core construct contract and leaf-path
APIs. The foundation exports the core construct declaration records and
`bind_core_implementation` through the public language, so libraries can supply
portable implementations without importing compiler internals.

The core construct, composition, selection, and materialization modules use
core APIs and dependency-neutral support annotations. Composition consumes core verification and dependency
summaries; selection consumes construct/composition contracts. Expansion and
target-lowering providers are supplied by callers, never imported from libraries
or simulator packages by core. `materialize.rhm` uses Builder and verification
to produce a new owned design and source-object maps, without frontend or
backend imports. Core `metadata.rhm` calls the remapping protocol declared in
`ir.rhm`; interface and sync owners implement it through their existing core IR
imports. No core dependency on frontend or event code is introduced.

## Dependency rules

- Core never imports analysis, frontend, backend, or RFPL code.
- Analysis consumes completed core IR and does not import authoring or lowering
  packages.
- Frontend code never imports a backend. Frontend layers do not import sibling
  layers; reusable cross-layer machinery belongs in `frontend/support/`.
- Backends and formal tools consume verified core IR without importing
  frontend syntax or elaboration.
- Standard, flow, and domain libraries use the public language rather than
  Rhodium implementation modules. Flow may depend on std, but std and Rhodium
  implementation packages must not import flow. Flow must not import downstream
  domain libraries.
- RFPL and diagram generation are downstream views. They inspect public IR but
  do not participate in hardware construction.
- SoCs do not depend on simulators. Simulation and VLSI integration depend
  inward on public SoC, backend, SRAM, and harness surfaces.
- SRAM mapping consumes post-CIRCT MLIR. Rhodium implementation packages and
  SoCs do not import it, and generic mapping code owns no foundry policy.

| [`../vlsi/`](../vlsi/README.md) | Physical-design integration, design/technology policy, and mapped simulation | Public authoring/backend surfaces; `sram/`; `sims/`; external VLSI tools and harnesses |

The event compiler and RHEG exchange generated descriptors and fixed DPI calls;
neither imports the other's implementation. Event inference consumes generic
interface metadata, not `flow` library implementation modules.

CHI consumers in cores, devices, SoCs, and simulators depend directly on the
defining CHI modules and on `std/interconnect.rhdl` for generic address/transfer
types. The compatibility facade is not a production dependency boundary; the
[CHI import guide](../chi/README.md#package-boundary-and-import) and its
developer implementation map identify the owners.
CHI's `protocol/`, `transactions/`, `home/`, `subordinate/`, `adapters/`, and
`noc/` directories refine that source ownership without changing package
dependency direction. The CHI boundary checker audits nested production files;
the pure `chi/noc/noc-authoring.rhm` bridge still imports only host NoC/support
modules, not Rhodium or CIRCT.

HardFloat is representative of an external domain library over the public
language: Rhodium implementation packages do not depend on it, while its tests
may consume a backend to validate ordinary lowering.

## Design commitments

- Keep one public hardware IR until a concrete feature requires another.
- Keep frontend conveniences out of core when existing hardware semantics are
  sufficient.
- Keep optional reports and policy analyses outside the core API when they can
  derive their facts from completed IR.
- Keep backends independent of frontend syntax and metadata.
- Use CIRCT rather than an Rhodium-owned SystemVerilog emitter.
- Keep widths explicit and elaboration deterministic.
- Keep generator parameters stable and immutable in the host language and runtime data in hardware.
- Specify and test implicit conversion, connection, priority, or reset behavior
  before adding it.

## Auditable direct-dependency inventories

The architecture above is the implementation contract. The tables below are
its review surface: keep them exact when modules or layer imports change. They list
direct Rhodium dependencies, not the full transitive closure.

The reusable packed execution module `cores/simd-alu.rhdl` directly imports
`std/bits.rhdl` for bit reversal and leading-zero count. Its remaining hardware
operations use the public language; it imports no ISA catalog or named core.

The reusable `cores/riscv/` mappings directly import `std/decode.rhdl` to map
pure RISC-V instruction catalogs onto root processor-component controls.
`cores/riscv/chi-hart.rhdl` imports `std/bits.rhdl` for power-of-two cache-line
configuration and NodeID-width checks. These modules import no named core.
The future Spike-backed core's `profile.rhm` imports `frontend/foundation.rhm`
only for the stable generator-parameter contract. In `riscv/rtl/`, `decode.rhdl` imports
`std/decode.rhdl`, while `atomic.rhdl` and `interrupt.rhdl` import
`std/bits.rhdl`; these modules materialize reusable architectural values and
policy without importing a concrete processor.

The `cores/rv5stage/vector/` package imports public `std/bits.rhdl` for
mask expansion/merging, `std/ready-valid.rhdl` for authorized CSR events, and
`flow/main.rhdl` for backpressured read plans, synchronous Valid read
transactions, operand-fetch context storage, and credited issue buffering. Its pure geometry
dependency is `riscv/isa/vector.rhm`; that module imports Rhombus metadata only
and has no Rhodium dependency. `riscv/rtl/vector.rhdl` imports public
`std/bits.rhdl`; `cores/rv5stage/decode/vector-ctrl.rhdl` imports public
`std/decode.rhdl`, pure ISA descriptors, RISC-V adapters, the shared SIMD ALU,
and the named vector mask-scan controls. `vector/mask.rhdl` imports public
`std/bits.rhdl` for bit reversal and first-set counting; it has no decode dependency.
The parent `cores/rv5stage/vector.rhdl` imports `flow/main.rhdl` for WB allocation,
compute/memory demultiplexing, fixed-cycle local acceptance, and macro outcomes.
`vector/pipeline.rhdl` imports Flow for atomic issue fanout, operand/result storage,
and accepted shared-service queues; it additionally imports named integer
register-write and FP contracts, vector mask-scan controls, pure FP profiles,
and public HardFloat rounding types. `vector/scoreboard.rhdl` and
`vector/load-response.rhdl` import Flow for ownership and completion events.
`vector/unroller.rhdl` imports vector bundles, named decode/FP controls,
the shared SIMD contracts, pure ISA geometry and instruction fields, the RISC-V
vector RTL adapter, bit helpers, and Flow. `vector/operand-fetch.rhdl` additionally
imports vector packing, the RISC-V FP unboxing adapter, and HardFloat formats;
the sequencer does not depend on operand fetch. Their shared read-plan types
live in `vector/bundles.rhdl`.
`vector/packed-memory.rhdl` imports the vector bundles and VRF contracts,
footprint arithmetic, vector decode/ISA geometry, public bit helpers,
and Flow. `vector/pipeline.rhdl` composes it with the existing execution engine
and imports the reusable load/store byte-mask helper. `vector/execute.rhdl`
imports public ready-valid types for its shared SIMD alignment client.
`vector/dependencies.rhdl` imports vector bundles, named decode controls, and
the pure vector/XLEN models plus the RISC-V vector RTL adapter; the execution
pipeline consumes its architectural destination-group mask for WAW admission.
`vector/memory.rhdl` imports Flow for fixed-cycle attempts and acceptance, the
named D-cache protocols and memory operations, and RISC-V trap/pointer-masking
adapters. `cores/rv5stage/memory-arbiter.rhdl` imports Flow for shared LSU
arbitration and tagged response routing, plus public `std/bits.rhdl` for
completion geometry. No memory adapter imports a cache implementation.
`vector/precheck.rhdl` imports vector descriptor/control types, the named MMU
precheck protocol, pure vector/XLEN geometry, and the public pointer-mask
adapter. `mmu/vector-window.rhdl` imports that MMU protocol, public RISC-V PMA
descriptors, and Flow; it imports no vector implementation. The MMU protocol
owns the range/probe interfaces, keeping dependency direction from vector to
translation contracts rather than from translation into vector execution.
`vector/fp.rhdl` imports those FP bundles and decode
controls plus RISC-V FP boxing helpers and HardFloat types to adapt packed
elements, without adding a reverse dependency from FP to vector. Scalar
pipeline bundles do not import the vector package or carry its packed data.
The vector pipeline and its bundles, scalar pipeline bundles, data/uncached
protocols, and data IO-MSHR directly import `std/bits.rhdl` for the `Pow2Int`
completion-depth annotation. Tag widths derive from the public `index_width`
operation; memory engines retain the specialized union opaquely.

`cores/rv5stage/integer-execution.rhdl` imports the reusable multiplier/divider
and `flow/main.rhdl` for typed, owner-retaining execution services. Scalar
`multiply.rhdl` and `divide.rhdl` use Flow queues for WB admission reservations;
the core uses Flow arbitration and stable demultiplexing to share those services.
`vector/muldiv.rhdl` imports the integer contracts, pure ISA geometry/XLEN, and
`std/bits.rhdl` for `Pow2Int`, without depending on sibling decode columns.

`cores/rv5stage/fp/execute.rhdl` directly imports `flow/main.rhdl` for
operand routing, reserved fixed-latency completion buffering, round-robin
completion arbitration, and output retention. The scalar `fp/pipeline.rhdl`
imports that service, `flow/main.rhdl`, `std/bits.rhdl`, and
`std/scoreboard.rhdl`; FPR state and architectural destinations stay in this
wrapper. `fp/div-sqrt.rhdl` directly imports `std/ready-valid.rhdl` and Flow's
`rr-arbiter`, `completion-queue`, `demux`, `gate`, and `queue` modules. No FP
implementation depends on the vector package or on test/backend code.
`cores/rv5stage/core.rhdl` directly imports the FP execution service and
HardFloat rounding types to compose scalar and vector operand clients around
one service. Generic request/result retagging remains in the FP bundles.

### Shared frontend support

Support modules implement shared mechanisms without becoming selectable
language profiles:

<details>
<summary>Show shared support-module responsibilities</summary>

- `hardware-types.rhm` generates an extension-defined scalar descriptor and
  exact hardware-value annotation from one declaration, using core's
  `HardwareType` contract and default `ScalarDataType` capability.
- `hardware-literal.rhm` validates reusable packed host images, exposes their
  hardware type and packed width to ordinary libraries, and materializes them
  as a `Bits` constant followed by an explicit equal-width cast.
- `hardware-methods.rhm` attaches exact receiver-owned method declarations and
  anchors their dispatch ahead of conservative value surfaces.
- `fields.rhm` owns `Bool`, the shared implementation behind exact and generic
  hardware method providers, receiver-owned scalar membership and width extension,
  extension-method resolution, exact hardware annotations, public
  hardware-value type discovery, shared canonical packing, and readable and
  driveable field static information.
- `instance-members.rhm` lets layers contribute virtual instance members
  without creating sibling-layer dependencies.
- `clocking.rhm` expands frontend sync policy into explicit ports, register
  operands, instance inputs, and drives, then certifies that every locally
  owned clocked effect uses the ambient clock. Resetless and locally reset
  state remain legal and are inventoried separately.
- `generator-parameters.rhm` extracts runtime bindings from the ordinary
  Rhombus parameter forms shared by circuit generators.
- `mux-lookup.rhm` lets independent layers contribute typed static keys,
  lookup selector behavior, and one-hot selector types without importing one
  another.
- `mask-type.rhm` lets independent layers require nominal lane-set semantics
  without importing the Boolean layer that owns `Mask` and its `Bool` indexing
  surface.
- `variants.rhm` centralizes nominal variant identity, automatic and explicit
  tag encodings, enum tag types, and exact member literals for enum and tagged-
  union layers.
- `one-hot-selection.rhm` defines the optional-selector protocol and keeps the
  partial exact-one-hot and total optional-one-hot lowering paths available to
  independent layers without sibling imports.

</details>

Domain libraries and adapters such as `chi/` and `riscv/rtl` consume the
public language and standard libraries. They do not become frontend layers and
cannot import Rhodium implementation packages.

The kernel's deferred-value protocol retains authoring metadata until an
operation consumes it. Reusable host descriptions remain distinct from
objects already owned by an elaborated circuit. These protocols do not add
frontend types or operations to the public core IR.

## Enforcement and file roles

[`../tools/check-boundaries.sh`](../tools/check-boundaries.sh) enforces these
directions, prevents sibling-layer imports, keeps `standard.rhm` aggregation
only, and restricts reader shims and `.rhdl` files to their intended
locations. Run `make check-boundaries` after moving or adding modules.

`.rhdl` is reserved for Rhodium-profile programs, public adapters, concrete core
designs, simulation adapters, physical-design integration fixtures, and
frontend or FESVR fixtures. `.rhm` contains Rhombus implementation and library
modules.
`.rkt` is restricted to reader shims and the Rosette engine whose solver-aided
language requires a Racket module boundary.

The equivalence tests under [`frontend/tests/`](frontend/tests/) and
[`backend/tests/`](backend/tests/) check that direct core construction,
kernel construction, explicit layer composition, and the standard language
produce the same public IR and CIRCT representation.

## Native consumer integration

`sim/extract.rhm`, `sim/composition.rhm`, `sim/objects.rhm`, and `sim/native-contract.rhm` import
`core/main.rhm` for
public hardware and construct contracts. The remaining simulator modules
import sibling simulator modules and Racket/Rhombus libraries. The standalone
compiler and runtime have no frontend dependencies. `sims/native/queue.rhm`
imports the public Flow Queue identity, core contracts, simulator target
records, and packed leaf descriptors from `sim/native-contract.rhm`; the generic extractor never imports Flow.
`sims/native/contracts.rhm` imports core, `SimulationContract`, and
`frontend/layers/interface.rhm` to export existing interface-transform metadata.
This optional adapter does not participate in implementation selection.
